**What do you mean by High Availability?**
   With the help of multiple chunk servers and good goals,
   files can be stored multiple times. Therefore, a certain level of
   high availability on a file level can be achieved easily.
   
   In addition, it is important to know that per default, the master service
   only can be active in a master role on one node at the time. If this node fails,
   e.g. because of broken hardware or out-of-memory situations, the current master
   has to be demoted (if still possible) and an existing shadow has to be promoted
   manually.
   
   If the failover happens automatically, a good state of high availability is
   achieved on a service level. Thus the term "High Availability" refers to
   keeping the master role alive when everything goes down under.



**How can I achieve High Availability of the master?**
   There are multiple ways of keeping the master highly available.
   
   One would be to demote and promote manually if you need to.
   The better way would be to delegate that task to a mechanism
   which knows the current state of all (possible) master nodes and
   can perform the failover procedure automatically.

   Known methods, when only using open-source software, are building Pacemaker/Corosync
   clusters with self-written OCF agents. Another way could be using keepalived.
   

**This is too complicated! I need a better solution for High Availability.**
   An official supported way to achieve high availablity of the master is to
   obtain the uRaft component from Skytechnology, the company behind LizardFS.
   
   Based on the RAFT algorithm, the uRaft service makes sure that all master nodes
   talk to each other and exchange information regarding their health states.
   In order to ensure that a master exists, the nodes participate in votes.
   If the current master fails, uRaft moves a floating IP from the formerly active node
   to the new designated master. All uRaft nodes have to be part of one network and must be able to
   talk to each other.
   
   The uRaft component can usually be obtained by signing a support contract with SkyTechnology.
